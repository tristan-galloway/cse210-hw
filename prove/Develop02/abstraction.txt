Abstraction is the process of taking large problems and breaking them down in to much smaller, more solvable tasks. By doing so it allows you to take more often breaks as parts of the process are finished. It also allows for a more modular building process instead of it needing to be done all at once. A way to use abstraction, like in this weeks assignment, is to take each of the three files that need created and get those made with outlines of each class and function. After that you can take time working on each one at a time then putting the pieces together as they are finshed. A simple example would be like breaking down getting a area squared for a using. You could start by having the user enter two sides. Then in a seperate function, using those obtained values to calculate the space. To check the math inside the calculation function instead of starting with the user input, you could start with two static values that you know the answer to so you can double check your work.
