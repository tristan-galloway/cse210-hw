Encapsulation is the process of containing code in groups they belong to. It helps us protect the data from ourselves in other parts of our program. A benefit to ecapsulated code is that it's easier to modify later on and change the actual storage of data. This week we used classes and made sure each class had a specific responsability and that all code associated with that responsiblity were contained to that class. Interacting with classes is done through getters and setters. For example, the scripture project had a class called "Word" and to get the value that was stored on creation, we had to call the GetDisplayText method. Or to access the boolean keeping track of the _hidden value we had to call the IsHidden method.
