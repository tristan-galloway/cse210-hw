Inheritance is the shown by the practice of parent and child classes. The parent class contains member variables and methods that are used by each child class. Each child class contains the member variables and methods that are unique to the given class as well as the parent class. This allows us to reuse code and save lots of time having to recode the same things over and over again. This week in our mindfulness activities we had all of the things that each class used like our ShowSpinner() and ShowCountDown() methods in the parent class Activity. Then had each of the unique Run() sequences in each of the individual child classes.
