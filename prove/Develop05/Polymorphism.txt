Polymorphism is the concept of having objects that are children of a superclass but inherit common functionality and variable while allowing the flexiblity of overwriting the functionality to fit each of the unique sub classes. This makes it so you can repeat code far less frequently but have the same function names. An example of this would be the prep assignment we made this week. There would be a parent class called shape and each subclass (circle, square, rectangle, etc...) would have it's have it's own method to calculate the area of the shape based on what shape it is. They all have the method, but overwrite it based on their individual needs.
